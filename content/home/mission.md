Our lab focuses on identifying the neuroanatomical substrate for symptoms common in autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions with a goal of direct translation into possible targets for noninvasive treatment modalities, e.g., TMS and/or fMRI-based neurofeedback.

This entails three interactive research arms:

 1) Generation of circuit-based hypotheses for specific symptoms from cohorts with lesions, tubers, tumor resections, etc.

 2) Validation of these localizations through prospective neuroimaging study of patients with neurodevelopmental disorders with similar symptoms, and 

 3) Testing whether this circuit can be modulated through non-invasive therapy, e.g., behavioral, fMRI-neurofeedback, or potentially TMS-based interventions.

<!-- We are also building an internal ‘clearinghouse’ of publicly available functional connectivity data, i.e., a *Developmental Atlas of Brain Connectivity*, linked to phenotypic data and processed in a consistent fashion, that will allow us to generate age-/sex-specific control cohorts for rare conditions as well as study the development of symptom-related circuits.-->
