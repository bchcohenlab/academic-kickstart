## I. Generating a Developmental Atlas of Brain Connectivity (2018 - present)

  Creating an atlas that combines all publicly available brain connectivity data, currently from more than 15,000 children and adolescents, into a single consistently processed and quality-controlled dataset that can be used by medical researchers as a ‘gold-standard’ reference of typical development.

## II. Lesion network mapping of Autism-related Symptoms (2018 - present)

  This project seeks to understand whether there is a particular network of regions impacted by lesions that are associated with social network impoverishment or loss of social skills, beyond that which can be explained by post-stroke depression and other independent risk factors. We are involved in a number of studies to help answer this question: 
    
### *1. Using clinical cohorts and functional connectivity to identify the neuroanatomical basis of atypical face processing in autism spectrum disorders*

  The goal of this project is to determine whether the pattern of cortical tubers in children with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and/or a specific predicted network abnormality predicts their face processing ability

### *2. Identifying the common neural substrate critical for face processing deficits*

  The goal of this project is to determine whether 1) the pattern of cortical tubers in children with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, and 2) functional connectivity abnormalities in adolescents with idiopathic Autism Spectrum Disorder converge on common network alterations that predict their face processing ability.

### *3. The neuroanatomical basis for face processing deficits in autism spectrum disorder*

  This study investigates the cause of face processing difficulties in ASD by leveraging information from patients with acquired prosopagnosia and prospective collection of MRI and behavioral data in adolescent subjects across a range of face-processing abilities.

### *4. Performance on the Benton Face Recognition Task demonstrates a persistent correlation with ADOS Social Affect across age, sex, and IQ in multiple NDAR datasets*

  Face processing difficulty affects a majority of individuals with ASD and while not part of the DSM-5 criteria for ASD, is thought to have significant effects on social skill deficits. This analysis assess the relationship between the Benton Face Recognition Task and ADOS Social Affect score to characterize the relationship between face processing abnormalities and social affect.
