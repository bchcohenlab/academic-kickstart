: Ivry grew up in Montreal and attended McGill University for undergrad, where he graduated with honors with a Bachelor of Science in Rehabilitation Science, majoring in Occupational Therapy. Subsequently, he enrolled in medical school at University of Montreal and completed his preclinical years in 2018. His strong interest in medical education led him to take a two-year leave from medical school to pursue the Master of Medical Sciences in Medical Education at Harvard Medical School, to graduate in 2020. During his time in Boston, he had the opportunity to be part of Dr. Cohenâ€™s Lab where he was introduced to the world of ASD research by investigating the relationship between social affect and face recognition. He will be completing his clinical clerkships and aspires to continue developing his passion for critical thinking and clinical research, whatever his clinical career may be.
