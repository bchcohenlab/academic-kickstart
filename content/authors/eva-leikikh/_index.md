Eva Leikikh is in her senior year at Pingree School in Hamilton, MA. Over the last three years, Eva has focused her studies on sciences and mathematics, as well as pursuing her interest in environmental studies and sustainability. Eva spent the summer of 2019 in Fiji studying marine biology and coral reef conservation. The work included reef surveys, planting mangroves, building natural sea walls, and removing invasive starfish. In her final year at Pingree, she will serve as varsity field hockey captain, Math Team captain, GAINS (Girls Advancing in STEM) club leader, and will complete her two year tenure as Green Team leader. Green Team focuses on education and initiatives surrounding conservation and sustainability. She intends to enter undergraduate studies next year on a pre-med track anchored in physics and neuroscience. This summer, Eva will be an intern working closely with Dr. Jurriaan Peters on segmenting lesions in the brain.
