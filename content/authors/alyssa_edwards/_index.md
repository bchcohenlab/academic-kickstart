Alyssa graduated from Case Western Reserve University with her Bachelor of Arts in Cognitive Science and her Master's of Public Health with a concentration in health promotion and disease prevention in May of 2020. She is currently a first year medical student at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. Alyssa's current research interests include Autism Spectrum, neuroimaging, and health disparities in individuals with developmental disabilities. She had a diverse background in research throughout her undergraduate career. From tracing the underlying causes of Autism using cerebral organoids, looking at genetic markers associated with prostate cancer, to traveling to Ghana in 2018 where she spent three months researching biomarkers associated with resistance to malaria. Fun fact, she climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro during her time in Africa.  Alyssa could not be happier to be a part of the Cohen Lab!
