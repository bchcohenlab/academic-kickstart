My name is Ayesha Imran, I am an undergrad senior at Emmanuel College, majoring in Neuroscience with minors in psychology and women/gender studies. I am fascinated with working with MRIs/fMRIs and analysis related to neuroimaging. I hope that during this internship I will gain a broader understanding of the clinical field of neurology and anticipate attaining skills that will prove useful when considering future opportunities. During my off time I usually try to help out at home, catch up with friends, go for hikes and do yoga or meditation. I am so excited to start this new position and get to know and work with everyone on the team!
