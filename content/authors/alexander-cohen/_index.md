Alexander Cohen is an Instructor of Neurology at Boston Children’s Hospital who specializes in translational neuroimaging approaches to understand and develop treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders. He earned his BA, MD, and PhD from Washington University in St. Louis, and did his Child Neurology training at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. He joined BCH in 2016 as a Pediatric Behavioral Neurology fellow and did his post-doctoral training in the Computational Radiology Laboratory at BCH and the Laboratory for Brain Network Imaging and Modulation at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. 

Now, he sees patients in the Autism Spectrum Center and Behavioral Neurology Clinic at BCH and has created a translational neuroimaging laboratory focusing on identifying the causal neuroanatomy of symptoms in autism that can serve as treatment targets for non-invasive stimulation.
