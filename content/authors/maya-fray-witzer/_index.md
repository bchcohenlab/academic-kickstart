Maya is a Psychology major and Japanese minor studying at Middlebury College in Vermont. Although she loves her campus jobs - ski-instructing and oratory coaching - Maya returns to the Boston area during the summers to work with various hospitals in the Longwood Area. Previously, she helped Dr. Cohen to find possible indicators of autism in MRI images, and more recently acquired some training in Python to aid him in the creation of a "developmental atlas" of connectomes. This summer, Maya is combining her passion for Psychology with her strengths in writing and public speaking as she steps into her new research assistant position in the Harvard Medical School Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital. She is excited to be part of an ongoing effort to educate the public about the importance of sleep, and to conduct heuristic testing on apps that could revolutionize public sleep hygiene.
