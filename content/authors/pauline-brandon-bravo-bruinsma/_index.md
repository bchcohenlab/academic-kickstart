Pauline graduated from VU University in Amsterdam in July 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in medicine and completed an additional extracurricular honors track. Her thesis focused on the treatment of children exhibiting early behavioral problems with callous-unemotional traits. She has developed an interest in studying pediatric disease and behavioral problems in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. For her research internship, as part of her master’s degree, she will investigate the locations of interictal spikes in serial EEG of infants with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. Next, she will apply Lesion Network Mapping to these locations to identify treatment targets in refractory infantile spasms. She will do her research under the supervision of Dr. Peters. She will start her rotations in the Netherlands afterwards.
