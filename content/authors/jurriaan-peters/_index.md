Jurriaan M. Peters MD, PhD, is an Assistant Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School, and is a pediatric epileptologist with additional expertise in clinical neurophysiology and neuroimaging. He earned his MD at the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, and his PhD at the University of Utrecht. He did his Child Neurology training and Clinical Neurophysiology fellowship training at Boston Children's Hospital.

He is the principal epileptologist at the Multidisciplinary Tuberous Sclerosis Clinic at Boston Children’s Hospital. His research in the Laboratory of Translational Neuroimaging and in the Computational Radiology Laboratory focuses on novel MRI and EEG modeling techniques in the localization of the seizure onset zone in children with medically refractory epilepsy, on how focal lesions give rise to a generalized epileptic encephalopathy; and on early medical and surgical treatment of epilepsy to mitigate detrimental effects on neurodevelopment.
