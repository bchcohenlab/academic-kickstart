Juliana graduated from Boston University in May 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in psychology. Topics of her previous research include semantic and pragmatic language development in young children, quality of life in caregivers of Parkinson’s Disease, and the genetics of learning disorders. She has developed an interest in studying brain development and disorders using neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and is excited to explore this interest at the Cohen Lab. In the future, she plans on earning her PhD in clinical psychology and pursuing research and clinical practice involving children with neurodevelopmental disorders. In her free time, she enjoys photography, traveling, learning languages, and playing the violin.
