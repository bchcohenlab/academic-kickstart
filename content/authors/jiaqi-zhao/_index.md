Jiaqi graduated from Syracuse University in December 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics. She developed an interest in Data Science through her undergraduate research experiences, and she is curious about brain composition and networks. Jiaqi is more than excited to join Cohen Lab and explore her interests further. In the future, she plans to pursue her master’s degree in Data Science. Besides being a pet blogger, she loves to watch movies, explore cool places, and play piano in her free time.
